## Development Workflow (Northstar)

### Vision-Aligned Planning (MANDATORY)

**STOP. Before starting ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps, multi-file, or research required), you MUST:**

### Before Starting - DO THIS FIRST

1. **Check for `.vision/`** - If exists, READ whatever vision files are there
2. **Check for `.progress/`** - Read existing plans to understand current state
3. **Create numbered plan** - ALWAYS save to `.progress/NNN_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_task-name.md` BEFORE writing code (NNN = next sequence number, e.g., 001, 002)
4. **If no `.vision/` exists** - That's fine for small tasks, or offer to create relevant docs

**DO NOT skip planning. DO NOT start coding without a plan file.**

### During Execution

1. **Update plan after each phase** - Mark phases complete, log findings
2. **Re-read plan before major decisions** - Keeps goals in attention window
3. **Document deviations** - If implementation differs from plan, note why
4. **The 2-Action Rule** - After every 2 significant operations, save key findings to plan file

### Before Completion

1. **Run `/no-cap`** - Verify no hacks, placeholders, or incomplete code
2. **Check vision alignment** - Does result match vision constraints?
3. **Update plan status** - Mark as complete with verification status
4. **Commit and push** (see Git Workflow below)

### Testing (Default Behavior)

- **Write tests for new code** - Any new feature or bug fix should have tests
- **Run tests before pushing** - Never push without running tests locally
- **If tests fail, fix before pushing** - Don't rely on CI to catch issues

### Multi-Instance Coordination

When multiple Claude instances work on shared tasks:
- Read `.progress/` plans before starting work
- Claim phases in the Instance Log section
- Update status frequently to avoid conflicts
- Use findings section for shared discoveries

### Git Workflow

When working on a task that involves planning followed by implementation:

1. **After implementing planned changes**, always commit with a clear, descriptive message
2. **Always push** to the current branch after committing
3. Use conventional commit format:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### Commands

- `/remind` - Show workflow checklist
- `/no-cap` - Verify implementation quality
